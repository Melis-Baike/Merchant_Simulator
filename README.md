# Merchant_Simulator
This is a little application about the merchant. Merchant has cart. Cart has load capacity ( 1000 kg ). We have some products. These products are available for purchase in the bazaars. Products also have condition ( Excellent, Good, Medium, Bad and Terrible ) We have 5 destinations (towns: Bishkek, Osh, Karakol, Talas, Naryn). Logically merchant buys some products in bazaar. But you have choice not to buy products. Something might happen to you along the way. It is event. We have next events ( Usual day, Rain, Smooth way, Broken cart, River, Meeting local, Robbers, Inn and Spoilage ) You travel 3 leagues per turn ( league like a kilometer ) After arriving in the town, you have able to sell your products ( if you have ). Products are sold at the specified coefficient in condition. And after selling, you can again buy goods and hit the road.
